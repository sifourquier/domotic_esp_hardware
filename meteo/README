Electronic for meteo sensors (Temperature Humidity Pressure)
Power by 1 or 2 battery 1.2V/1.5V or 5V (mini USB)
1 batterie R14 can spupply for more of 6 months if configured on static ip
 
FIXME
If use with only 1battery the stepup are to low current i have fix it by using 0x220uF on the power but work only if the connection time are low (use IP fix do not use dhcp)
If you use a rechargabel battery you can chage with connecting to usb but the heating of charge distorts the measure
